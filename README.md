# Card Match Game : Project Documentation

## Project Overview
The blockchain-based card match game is an innovative take on the classic memory game where players are rewarded with blockchain-based tokens for finding matching pairs. Each tile in the game is represented by a unique blockchain token, making it a collectible asset that players can keep forever in their digital wallets. The game leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity, security, and transferability of these tokens, allowing players to trade or sell them on a marketplace or keep them as valuable collectibles.
