# Card Match Game : Project Documentation

## Project Overview
The blockchain-based card match game is an innovative take on the classic memory game where players are rewarded with blockchain-based tokens for finding matching pairs. Each tile in the game is represented by a unique blockchain token, making it a collectible asset that players can keep forever in their digital wallets. The game leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity, security, and transferability of these tokens, allowing players to trade or sell them on a marketplace or keep them as valuable collectibles.
## Tech Stack Used:
* Non-fungible tokens (NFTs): Tokens representing unique digital assets, used to represent each tile in the card match game.
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React is used to create the interactive and dynamic components of the game's frontend.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server and handling server-side logic.
* Truffle framework: Framework for writing smart contracts and deploying them on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum.
* MetaMask: Browser extension and crypto wallet used for creating and managing Ethereum wallets, interacting with smart contracts, and facilitating transactions.
* Ganache: Local blockchain network used for development and testing purposes, providing a simulated blockchain environment.
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code, including smart contracts, JavaScript, and frontend components.
  
## Setup and Installation

## Running the Project
* Install NodeJs 9.10.0 dependencies
* Install Truffle framework : `npm install --g truffle@5.1.39`
* Download Ganache.
* Install Metamask chrome extension.
* Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/GaytriMohapatra/cardmatchgamewblockchain.git`
* Set up Node package manager (npm): `npm nstall`
* Start the Server locally : `npm run start`
  
## Blockchain Integration:
* Each tile in the game corresponds to a unique blockchain-based token.
* The tokens are created and managed.
 on a blockchain network, ensuring their immutability and security.
* Once tokens are earned in the game, they become permanent assets stored on the blockchain.
* Players can view their token collection, track their value, and manage them within the game interface.
  ## Token Ownership and Transferability:
* Players have full ownership of the tokens they earn in the game.
* Tokens can be transferred outside of the game to other wallets or exchanges.
* Players can sell their tokens on a dedicated marketplace, trade them with other players, or simply keep them as valuable digital collectibles.

## Key Features:
* Blockchain-based tokenization of in-game assets.
* Secure storage and ownership tracking of tokens.
* Integration with digital wallets for token management.
* Marketplace for buying, selling, and trading tokens.
* Real-time value tracking of tokens based on market demand.

## Benefits:
* Players can earn real value by playing the game and collecting tokens.
* Blockchain technology ensures transparency, security, and permanence of token ownership.
* Tokens can be part of a larger ecosystem of blockchain-based games and collectibles.
* Provides a new level of engagement and incentive for players to participate and compete.
